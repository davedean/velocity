Velocity
========

It's a fancy for loop for working on multiple servers over ssh.

I've used something like this for many years to manage groups of servers. 


## Usage 
You can use such a tool many different ways:

- put it in a folder with a 'hosts' file and run it from there

ie:
	$ echo 'servername' > hosts
	$ ./velocity 

- create a heirachy of project/environment/hosts files and run it from your path

ie:
put velocity on your path and then create folders like:
	project/servergroup1/hosts
	project/servergroup2/hosts

Then to operate on servergroup1 you do this:
	$ cd project/servergroup1/
	$ velocity ls

and to operate on servergroup2 you do this:
	$ cd ../servergroup2/
	$ velocity ls 

You can also create an 'ssh-options' file which takes in option/value pairs, one per line and will be used as part of the ssh command. Options aren't always sourced (eg: in an ssh-copy-id) so it's generally better to use ~/.ssh/config to set ssh options. 

## coming soon

I've used the -p and -g operators for 'put' and 'get' in the past, I'll probably implement them again soon.
